# SimpleAssembler
A simple MIPS assembler code for Computer Architecture Term Project.
NOTE THAT:
the register file for the project consist of 8 16-bit registers of Logisim.
The file path can be changed from the FILENAME variable.
The hexadecimal.txt can be used in Load Image for the Logisim ROM Module.

This project takes the assembly code and give 32 bit instructions that can be used with a model processor.
